# PyBer_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the total fares by week for the three types of cities PyBer serves: Urban, Suburban and Rural. By looking at these weekly averages we may be able to see trends that will dictate business decisions in the future for PyBer

## Results
From this sampling, it is clear that the Urban cities that PyBer serves are responsible for the majority of its revenue. In fact, the Urban cities account for 13X the income in Total Fares than the Rural cities, and 2.6 times the revenue in Total Fares than the Suburban cities. However, Urban cities have considerably more drivers working, more than 10 times the number working in rurla areas in fact. This could be an opportunity for growth for PyBer. Average Fares per ride are quite high in the Rural areas, and transportation is always a need in such areas. With driver recruitment and increased presence in these areas, PyBer might be able to increase overall revenues while serving an important function in rural communities. This could be an area to investigate for PyBer in the future.

The line chart found below tells a similar story. The stark difference between Rural and Urban fares per week is shown clearly on this chart. There is some fluctuation according to the time of year, but nothing that can really be called conclusive. In order to understand trends in use of PyBer according to the time of year, a larger sampling would need to be considered, with at least a year of data and preferably two or more, in order to clearly identify trends.

## Summary
Through examination of this ride data, we can see that there is a potential for growth in the Rural markets that PyBer serves. However, there would need to be more investigation in terms of the need in these areas and the potential to hire many more drivers to meet the need. If this is not a viable option, than PyBer might reconsider its Rural presence in the future, as the revenue and usage there lags behind both Suburban and Urban revenuse substantially.
